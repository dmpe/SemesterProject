Load and read excel file

```{r}
library(xlsx)
library(mi)
library(mice)
datasetM <- read.xlsx("Data/DataSet_01.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1, endRow=277)

```

What type of variables we have ?

```{r}
mi.info(datasetM)
typecast(datasetM)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
