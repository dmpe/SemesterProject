## Goal
Look at the US NYS Attorney Registrations. 

Source of data : <https://data.ny.gov/Transparency/NYS-Attorney-Registrations/eqw2-r5nb>

## Get the data

First we load some libraries.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(stringi)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

I used CSV file downloaded from their website. Using `readr` package I skip 2 columns which are low interest to me and finally present a summary statistics. Here I am going to deal with characters only.

```{r}

data.NYS <- readr::read_csv("/srv/shiny-server/SemesterProject/Data/NYS_Attorney_Registrations.csv",
                            col_types = list("Zip" = col_character(), "Zip Plus Four" = col_character(), 
                                             "Suffix" = col_skip(), "Middle Name" = col_skip()))

summary(data.NYS)
```

## Data cleansing

Because data contain blank cells, I need to replace "" (basically nothing - empty spaces) with NAs. Then I also rename columns.

```{r}
data.NYS[data.NYS == ""] <- NA
colnames(data.NYS) <- c("ID", "F.Name", "L.Name", "Comp.Name", "Street_1", "Street_2", "City", "State", "Zip", "Zip_2", "Country", "County",  "Phone", "Email", "Year_Adm", "JDoA", "Law_School", "Status", "Next_Reg")
```

### What kind of email providers lawyers used to register ?

Using `stringi` package we split Email column into a matrix. Then we omit As (i.e. those cells that we replaced above) and "convert" the matrix to a data frame. Letters before @ get "NickName" column name and after @ "Organisation". Because people cannot fill in their email properly (or maybe because of <http://rickrobinson.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/it-systems.jpg>). As a result I need to use `tolower` function.

Finally using `table` function I get frequencies of email providers. [#Google](https://www.google.de/search?q=gmail+is+unique) leads.

```{r}
splitted.email <- stri_split_fixed(data.NYS$Email, "@", 2, omit_empty = NA, simplify = TRUE) 
splitted.email <- data.frame(na.omit(splitted.email))
colnames(splitted.email) <- c("NickName", "Organisation")

splitted.email <- data.frame(table(tolower(splitted.email$Organisation)))
splitted.email <- plyr::arrange(splitted.email, desc(splitted.email$Freq))
head(splitted.email, 15)
```

Not so many law firm, right. Actually just two (not counting the government itself, of course): <http://www.legal-aid.org/en/home.aspx> and <http://www.skadden.com/>

### What kind of law school did people attend ?

Here I can use same code, but what is far more interesting is that people fill in their law school totally differently. Well, I get that from the foreigners but what about "Harvard", "Harvard Law School" and "Harvard University"" (very US-centric) ...... Just look at that. I mean common... 

```{r}
law_school <- data.frame(table(tolower(data.NYS$Law_School)))
law_school <- plyr::arrange(law_school, desc(law_school$Freq))
head(law_school, 15)
```

Four lawyers even wrote "harvard 1950". Furthermore, there are e.g. 551 occurences of harvard in the `Law_School` column. The most interessting fact to me was that some people cannot even spell properly their law school name. I wouldn't want to go to such lawyers :(  [OMG](http://www.freemake.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SpellRite-1.gif)

Source for code below: <http://www.r-bloggers.com/select-operations-on-r-data-frames/>
```{r}
harvard <- law_school[grep("harvard", law_school$Var1, ignore.case=T),]
head(harvard)
count(harvard)

newyork <- law_school[grep("new york", law_school$Var1, ignore.case=T),]
head(newyork)
count(newyork)

law_school[grep("new york law shool", law_school$Var1, ignore.case=T),]

brooklyn <- law_school[grep("brooklyn", law_school$Var1, ignore.case=T),]
head(brooklyn)
count(brooklyn)

johns <- law_school[grep("johns|john's", law_school$Var1, ignore.case=T),]
head(johns)
count(johns)

```

### Where does lawyers work



```{r}
law_school <- data.frame(table(tolower(data.NYS$Law_School)))
law_school <- plyr::arrange(law_school, desc(law_school$Freq))
```
